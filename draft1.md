This is just a first ***draft*** of my essay. 
I'm still working on how to work with Markdown.
But I do firmly believe Markdown can help me tremendously with my writing and stuff like that.

How can I become someone who is impossible to read?

Also does Markdown work with Facebook posts? 
I'm curious like genuinely curious.
